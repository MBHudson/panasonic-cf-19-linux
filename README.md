# Panasonic Toughbook CF-19 mk2-mk7
### Kubuntu 21.04 3/2021
## Updated 2/1/21
### Sound Fix
### Screen Calibration Tweak
### Fingerprint Reader Driver
## Improved Functionality:
- touch screen calibration and long-press - right-click functionality
- tablet-buttons driver (on-screen keyboard, enter, screen-rotation, lock buttons)
- screen rotation script, which rotates touch-screen also with the desktop
- on-screen keyboard toggle script (for onboard app)

## Note: This is just for a project I'm working on. Sometime later I will write much of this into a script, organize and document better. For now I just hope this helps someone else out.
